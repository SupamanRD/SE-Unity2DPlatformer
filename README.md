In order to run our project, from the canvas submission archive: Navigate to the Build Materials folder and double click .exe file. Note the other two items in this folder must stay with the .exe in order for
it to work as explained in our wiki.
To run from our github archive: Same as above. The entire set of files is too large too upload to github.

The unit test must be run from within Unity using the Test Runner. It is found in Assets/Scripts/NewPlayModeTest.cs.
